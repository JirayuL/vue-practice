# Template Syntax
Vue.js uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instanceâ€™s data. All Vue.js templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers.

 Vue is able to intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.
