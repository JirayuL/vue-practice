# Class and Style Bindings
A common need for data binding is manipulating an elementâ€™s class list and its inline styles. Since they are both attributes, we can use `v-bind` to handle them: we only need to calculate a final string with our expressions. However, meddling with string concatenation is annoying and error-prone. For this reason, Vue provides special enhancements when `v-bind` is used with `class` and `style`. In addition to strings, the expressions can also evaluate to objects or arrays.
